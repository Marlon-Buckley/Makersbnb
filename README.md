## How to create a new branch

`$ git switch -c joe-branch`

After changes, push to your branch:

 '$ git add .'  
 '$ git commit -m "amended README"'    
 `$ git push --set-upstream origin joe-branch' (only the first time you push otherwise it is 
 `$ git push`

 Then do a Pull request, set Reviewers for your PR and then Merge.

### Viewing listings
  
  * As a user of MakersBnB

  * So that I can choose a place to stay

  * I'd like to see a list of all listings on the site
